STEM (science, technology, engineering, &amp; mathematics) needs wisdom; and so does the world to provide secure software solutions.... 'When the two are not prudently aligned, society may stop to think with wisdom.' ( Journal of University Teaching &amp; Learning Practice, 13(2), p. 14 [https://ro.uow.edu.au/jultlp/vol13/iss2/4] ).  As The Open University T173 Block 1 (2007, p.38) also denotes, 'a poorly managed engineering project can be chaotic as a badly directed orchestra.' Here, it is like 'putting knowledge to test' (Microsoft Mechanics Live 2023 [Azure Migrate Tutorial - Training | Microsoft Learn] ); and where capacity needs meet appropriate application innovations. Thanks for this space, and being so inclusive - quite a humbling experience, indeed.
